      content="Maraka Humanitarian Observatory (MHO) is a joint initiative of Crossroads Advisory (CA) and Migration Research Cell (MRC), Department of Political Science, University of Peshawar. Womenâ€™s Regional Network has provided seed funding for the Observatory. Maraka is a Pashto word with variations in Dari/Hazargi/Persian and Shina languages, referring to a gathering of diverse people for articulating and discussing issues. The MHO aims to provide a platform for multiple actors to discuss emerging trends in humanitarian governance; it seeks to facilitate collaboration through learning, exchange, strategic thinking and calls for action."

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
